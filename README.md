# Recoustify

Recoustify is a web app that transforms any playlist into an acoustic or remixed version (using the Spotify Web API).

Log in with your Spotify account and Recoustify will display all of your personal and followed playlists,
allowing you to make any of them acoustic or remixed. Recoustify will search for the acoustic/remixed versions
of the songs in your playlist and add them in if they exist. Then, you can save it directly to your account with
a single click!

Recoustify is live here:
